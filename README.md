This order processing system efficiently manages the different processes required to complete an order by dividing them down into specialized components. When a consumer puts an order, the system initially calculates the overall cost using the item price and quantity. Then it takes the customer's name and address to place the order. Following that, it generates an invoice document outlining the purchase and saves it to a chosen file. Finally, the system sends the consumer an email notification including the order details.
